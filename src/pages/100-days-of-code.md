## Daily log

**Day 2: 08 August 2020**

_Today's Progress_:

- Completed section 1.2 of [Practical Python Programming](https://github.com/dabeaz-course/practical-python)

_Thoughts_: It feels good to get back into Python again. Still on the search for some good tutorials or new languages to try out too! I will probably go back to the [freeCodeCamp certifications](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn), I remember they were very practical.

**Day 1: 07 August 2020**

_Today's Progress_:

- Completed Java tutorial on SoloLearn
- Starting [Practical Python Programming](https://github.com/dabeaz-course/practical-python)
  - Completed section 1.1
- Brainstorming ideas for future projects

_Thoughts_: I've only just started learning Java, so I have a grasp on the Java basics - still need to practice more OOP concepts though. I want to keep up my Python skills with a hands-on approach, so I'll be doing one section of the Practical Python Programming course every day.

Still not too sure about what type of projects to make. Right now, the goal is to learn as many different technologies as I can by following interesting tutorials that I find.

## Future projects

- LOA app
- Pomodoro timer
- Appointment scheduler
- Dashboard
