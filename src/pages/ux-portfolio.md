Show some structured thought and intended problem to solve

# 3 steps of developing UX

## Fix an existing product

Take a look at products you use everyday and consider the problems in their experience.

Don't jump straight to the solution - find and understand the problem first.

Look at the company's or app reviews, and check to see if anybody else has written about the issue before.

## Explore a problem space

Notice any existing and unaddressed problems.

Conduct some research to explore the problem - see who is struggling with it.

Try doing a user research survey, then consider one-on-one interviews.

Check if there are any other products that try to solve this and complete a competitive analysis or heuristic evaluation.

## Create a prototype for a new idea

Follow through the design process.

# What do successful products look like?

Attract the right people

Prove their value - communicate clearly what it can do (i.e. features, benefits and outcomes)

Convert people from being curious to being a customer

# Marketing a product and marketing yourself

Provide clarity of the message and your ability to communicate

Conduct research to inform ideas then iterate through user flows, wireframes and prototypes

Writing about your projects helps ensure that you are clearly communicating the details that matter 

# Tell the story of the project

Answer 3 questions in a succinct and human way:

1. What the product was and the problem to be solved?
2. What you did and why you did it?
3. What was the outcome?

Stories help transform a message from a set of facts or steps and transport the reader into the workd of that project, taking them behind the scenes and into your head

# 3 tactical tips for telling a memorable story about your projects

## Don't just say what you did, say why you did it

Any time you show a screen or user-flow be sure to talk about the user

If you introduced personas, reference that person and how the solution served them

Could include a little photo of the person and quote from research interviews

## Don't let your portfolio read like a set of instructions. Make sure you include insights too

Talk about the research and what you learned

## Don't show everything; show the right things

Show the most interesting parts of the experience

Highlights the bits of the interface or layout that you believe were the greater solution

# Aspects of your portfolio

- In-depth case study
- Link projects to one another
- Users need to understand what you do, where you are and how you work
- Attention to details - quality images, everything needs to be clean and polished
- How did you arrive at the solution through problem definition activities 
  - Diverging and convergent thinking
  - Design thinking is a framework to plan and communicate to different stakeholders
- 3 Is of storytelling - insight, innovation, impact
  - Insight: situate the problem and design target
  - Innovation: describes what you designed relative to addressiing goals and needs of the target while solving the problem
  - Impact: how well the thing you made solves for the problem for the design target
- Interactive, scannable, readable
  - Headlines covering the gist of the project
- Narrow down portfolio to the work that you want to get hired for
