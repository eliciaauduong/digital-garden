- User experience encompasses all aspects of the end-user's interaction with the company, its services and its products
  - Human-centered design approach built around the journey from first engagement to the point they end engagement
  - Involves:
    - Market research
    - Usability tests
    - User feedback analysis
- 8 golden rules for user interface design
  - Strive for consistency - identical terminology, consistent colour, layout, capitalisation and fonts
  - Seek universal usability - novice vs expert, accessibility, cultural background
  - Offer informative feedback - know where you are in the process and what is going on
  - Design dialogues to yield closure - tell users what their action has led them to
  - Prevent errors - users should not be able to make serious mistakes, small mistakes should be isolated and fixable
  - Permit easy reversal of actions - undo any action you take
  - Keep users in control - users should be able to rely on interface to respond to commands in a predictable way, without any surprises or variations in behaviour
  - Reduce short term memory load - users should not need to remember information as they traverse displays
- 7 principles for inclusive design
  - Provide comparable experience - so people can accomplish tasks in a way that suits their needs without undermining the quality of the content
  - Consider situation - deliver a valuable experience regardless of circumstances
  - Be consistent - use familiar conventions and use them consistently
  - Give control - people should be able to access and interact with content in their preferred way, not one imposed by the interface
  - Offer choice - consider providing different ways for people to complete tasks
  - Prioritise content - help users focus on core tasks, features, and information by prioritising them within the content and layout
  - Add value - consider the value of features and how they improve the experience for different users
