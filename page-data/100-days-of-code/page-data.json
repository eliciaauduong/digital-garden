So, I was not able to complete much of it today. Instead, I worked on the Responsive Web Design Certification and will return to the ES6 section tomorrow.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 9: 15 August 2020</strong></p>\n<p><em>Today's Progress</em>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Completed section 2.2 of <a href=\"https://github.com/dabeaz-course/practical-python\">Practical Python Programming</a></li>\n<li>Continued working on <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/\">JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Thoughts</em>: Today, I really pushed through and finished the Basic JavaScript section of the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification. This is the largest part of the certification (other than the projects) so I'm happy that I was able to finish it in 4 days.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 8: 14 August 2020</strong></p>\n<p><em>Today's Progress</em>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Completed section 2.1 of <a href=\"https://github.com/dabeaz-course/practical-python\">Practical Python Programming</a></li>\n<li>Continued working on <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/\">JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Thoughts</em>: I think that it's good for me to keep learning more about Python and Javascript but I feel like I should be creating more. I would like to ship a couple of projects before the end of the challenge.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 7: 13 August 2020</strong></p>\n<p><em>Today's Progress</em>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Completed section 1.7 of <a href=\"https://github.com/dabeaz-course/practical-python\">Practical Python Programming</a></li>\n<li>Continued working on <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/\">JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Thoughts</em>: One week into the challenge and I'm feeling good! 7 DAYS DONE!</p>\n<p><strong>Day 6: 12 August 2020</strong></p>\n<p><em>Today's Progress</em>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Completed section 1.6 of <a href=\"https://github.com/dabeaz-course/practical-python\">Practical Python Programming</a></li>\n<li>Starting <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/\">JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification</a></li>\n<li>Restarting <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/\">Responsive Web Design Certification</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Thoughts</em>: I want to update my portfolio to showcase my skills in web development again. However, after retrying the projects in the Responsive Web Design Certification, I realised that I have forgotten some principles and decided to restart the certification. I'm officially a #CodingNewbie again.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 5: 11 August 2020</strong></p>\n<p><em>Today's Progress</em>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Completed section 1.5 of <a href=\"https://github.com/dabeaz-course/practical-python\">Practical Python Programming</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Thoughts</em>: Slowly but steadily making my way through this course.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 4: 10 August 2020</strong></p>\n<p><em>Today's Progress</em>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Completed section 1.4 of <a href=\"https://github.com/dabeaz-course/practical-python\">Practical Python Programming</a></li>\n<li>Started brainstorming ideas for dashboard project</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Thoughts</em>: Had to remind myself to work on the Practical Python Programming course, but it's building into a habit that I enjoy. I've been having a look at different dashboards that others have created and I'm picking out the different features that I like and want to implement in my own project.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 3: 09 August 2020</strong></p>\n<p><em>Today's Progress</em>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Completed section 1.3 of <a href=\"https://github.com/dabeaz-course/practical-python\">Practical Python Programming</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Thoughts</em>: I'm getting back into the rhythm of coding in Python. I realised that I didn't have a clear direction with the different technologies that I wanted to learn. So, I'll be looking into how to develop web applications as well as languages for data analysis as I'm interested in these two areas.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 2: 08 August 2020</strong></p>\n<p><em>Today's Progress</em>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Completed section 1.2 of <a href=\"https://github.com/dabeaz-course/practical-python\">Practical Python Programming</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Thoughts</em>: It feels good to get back into Python again. Still on the search for some good tutorials or new languages to try out too! I will probably go back to the <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn\">freeCodeCamp certifications</a>, I remember they were very practical.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 1: 07 August 2020</strong></p>\n<p><em>Today's Progress</em>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Completed Java tutorial on SoloLearn</li>\n<li>\n<p>Starting <a href=\"https://github.com/dabeaz-course/practical-python\">Practical Python Programming</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Completed section 1.1</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Brainstorming ideas for future projects</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Thoughts</em>: I've only just started learning Java, so I have a grasp on the Java basics - still need to practice more OOP concepts though. I want to keep up my Python skills with a hands-on approach, so I'll be doing one section of the Practical Python Programming course every day.</p>\n<p>Still not too sure about what type of projects to make. Right now, the goal is to learn as many different technologies as I can by following interesting tutorials that I find.</p>\n<h2>Future projects</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>LOA app</li>\n<li>Pomodoro timer</li>\n<li>Appointment scheduler</li>\n<li>Dashboard</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"#100DaysOfCode","root":"challenge","date":"17 August 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/100-days-of-code/"}}}
