I've been having a look at different dashboards that others have created and I'm picking out the different features that I like and want to implement in my own project.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 3: 09 August 2020</strong></p>\n<p><em>Today's Progress</em>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Completed section 1.3 of <a href=\"https://github.com/dabeaz-course/practical-python\">Practical Python Programming</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Thoughts</em>: I'm getting back into the rhythm of coding in Python. I realised that I didn't have a clear direction with the different technologies that I wanted to learn. So, I'll be looking into how to develop web applications as well as languages for data analysis as I'm interested in these two areas.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 2: 08 August 2020</strong></p>\n<p><em>Today's Progress</em>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Completed section 1.2 of <a href=\"https://github.com/dabeaz-course/practical-python\">Practical Python Programming</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Thoughts</em>: It feels good to get back into Python again. Still on the search for some good tutorials or new languages to try out too! I will probably go back to the <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn\">freeCodeCamp certifications</a>, I remember they were very practical.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 1: 07 August 2020</strong></p>\n<p><em>Today's Progress</em>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Completed Java tutorial on SoloLearn</li>\n<li>\n<p>Starting <a href=\"https://github.com/dabeaz-course/practical-python\">Practical Python Programming</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Completed section 1.1</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Brainstorming ideas for future projects</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Thoughts</em>: I've only just started learning Java, so I have a grasp on the Java basics - still need to practice more OOP concepts though. I want to keep up my Python skills with a hands-on approach, so I'll be doing one section of the Practical Python Programming course every day.</p>\n<p>Still not too sure about what type of projects to make. Right now, the goal is to learn as many different technologies as I can by following interesting tutorials that I find.</p>\n<h2>Future projects</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>LOA app</li>\n<li>Pomodoro timer</li>\n<li>Appointment scheduler</li>\n<li>Dashboard</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"#100DaysOfCode","root":"challenge","date":"04 September 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/100-days-of-code/"}}}
